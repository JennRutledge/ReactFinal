                I am a creative learner and sharing person. I love to learn, I love to share 
                what I have learned and I also love to create.
                I have accomplished a lot over my life time. I 
                raised 3 amazing humans who are out in the world
                exploring their worlds and doing their best to live
                the best lives possible.

                The Chaos is what many first see when they
                see me. I raised three humans close in age. 
                They were busy. I am a Girl Scout Leader for a multi-age
                level group of pre-k to high school girls. Some times
                things do look crazy at meetings. I also have 5
                grandkids that are all under 5! The chaos is my bliss!
